I have created this application using C# .NET Core 2.1 and Angular 5.

SDK for .NET core can be found here https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1

Technologies that I have used to solve this problem are:

1. Visual Studio - 2017
2. .NET Core 2.1
3. Angular 5
4. NodeJs (I have used latest version of NodeJs 8.11.3 and this can be found here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
5. XUnit for Unit testing. I have used TDD approach so solve from business layer to implement the model for API.
6. FluentAssertions to test the assertion in easy way.
7. Moq to mock API calls as same as Repository pattern.
8. Swagger UI for documenting the API and testing.
9. Newton.Json package for json deserialization.
10. Async programming to call API.
11. Entity Framework Core with Fluent api.


API Documentation.
The API is integrated with Swagger to provide the documentation and contract and easy way to make API call.
This page will give detail of the API and you can use Try It button to test the API call.
